A utility to flatten component pyramids in React.

## Installation

```
npm i react-compose-components
```

## Inspiration and Usage

If you have ever worked on a large-scale React application you are probably
familiar with what I refer to as a "provider pyramid." Consider an application
that uses [`react`], [`redux`], [`glamorous`], [`react-i18next`],
[`react-instantsearch`] (Algolia), [`react-router`], and perhaps some internal
providers. You could have a root component that looks something like this:

```jsx
// ...
export default () => (
  <Router history={history}>
    <ThemeProvider theme={theme}>
      <I18nextProvider i18n={i18n}>
        <ReduxProvider store={store}>
          <InternalProvider1>
            <InternalProvider2>
              <App />
            </InternalProvider2>
          </InternalProvider1>
        </ReduxProvider>
      </I18nextProvider>
    </ThemeProvider>
  </Router>
);
```

With this library, you can do the following:

```jsx
import Compose from 'react-compose-components';
//..
export default () => (
  <Compose
    components={[
      [Router, { history }],
      [ThemeProvider, { theme }]
      [ReduxProvider, { store }]
      InternalProvider1,
      InternalProvider2,
      App,
    ]}
  />
);
```

This flattens the pyramid leading to better maintainability and cleaner VCS diffs.

The `Compose` component also accepts children:

```jsx
import Compose from 'react-compose-components';
//..
export default () => (
  <Compose
    components={[
      [Router, { history }],
      [ThemeProvider, { theme }]
      [ReduxProvider, { store }]
      InternalProvider1,
      InternalProvider2,
    ]}
  >
    <App />
  </Compose>
);
```

## API

This package has one default export, a component called `Compose`. `Compose`
requires a single prop, `components`. `components` is an array of any of the
following:

* A React component.
* A string (tag name such as `'div'`).
* A two-element array where the first element is either a React component or a
  string, and the second element is an object representing props to pass to the
  component.

## TypeScript

This package is written in TypeScript and ships with built-in typings.
